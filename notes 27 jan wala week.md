Rama kumar econ on agri
## Abstract
The article evaluates India's agricultural sector from 2014 to 2024, focusing on growth, rural employment, cultivation economics, and government policies. Key findings include:

1. **Economic Decline**: The period saw an economic slowdown, poor rural employment growth, declining investment incentives, and reduced farmer profitability due to slower agricultural price growth compared to cultivation costs.
    
2. **Unfulfilled Promises**: The government failed to meet electoral promises, including doubling farm incomes and raising minimum support prices.
    
3. **Policy Resistance**: Efforts to reform agricultural marketing laws faced unified resistance from farmers.
    
4. **Government Missteps**: Measures like restrictions on cattle trade, demonetization, GST reforms, and a weak Covid-19 response caused significant farmer distress and harmed the agrarian economy.
