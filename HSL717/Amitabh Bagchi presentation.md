## Priorities of the imperial order

### **India’s Special Position in British Imperialism**

India was the most valuable colonial possession of the British Empire, maintained well beyond the age of British economic dominance. ==Before 1914, India was Britain’s largest foreign market==, particularly for cotton textiles and engineering goods. India’s exports to hard currency areas were crucial in maintaining the balance of payments within the British Empire. The mechanisms of financial transfers—‘home charges,’ capital profits, and shipping costs—allowed Britain to extract economic surpluses from India to sustain its gold standard and imperial administrative costs. The Indian economy was thus deeply integrated into British economic structures, serving as a reservoir of wealth that Britain could rely upon to maintain financial stability and economic supremacy.

### **Economic Exclusiveness and British Trade Monopoly**

Despite the outward claim of free trade, British policy in India ensured exclusivity for British goods. Government patronage was extended primarily to British manufacturers, and imports from non-British sources were discouraged. The ==prevailing ethos== among British officials and traders reinforced this bias. Unlike other white-settler colonies such as Canada, Australia, and South Africa, India was prevented from adopting state-supported industrial policies, including tariff protection, which could have promoted domestic industries. ==Consequently, while settler colonies maintained an import surplus with Britain, India consistently had an export surplus, ensuring a steady stream of wealth from India to Britain==. Indian traders and industrialists were systematically denied access to the same privileges afforded to their British counterparts, keeping the Indian economy subservient to British interests.

### **Industrial Backwardness and the 'Open Door' Policy**

India’s economic structure was shaped to serve British imperial interests rather than domestic development. Unlike Britain’s settler colonies, which attracted British investment, most foreign investment in India was limited to reinvestment of British profits earned locally. The ‘Open Door’ policy was enforced through both government policy and racial discrimination, which excluded Indians from profitable economic positions. ==This arrangement ensured British dominance in banking, trade, and industry.== The economic policies of the British government were designed not only to extract wealth but also to prevent the rise of an independent Indian industrial base that could challenge British economic supremacy.

### **Railway Expansion and Imperial Financial Priorities**

The expansion of India’s railway system was constrained by Britain’s financial priorities. While British industrialists favored railway expansion to increase demand for British goods and boost Indian exports, the Government of India (under the Secretary of State) prioritized financial stability to ensure uninterrupted fund transfers to Britain. Imperial fiscal policies often overrode the interests of British businessmen in India, revealing a conflict between broader imperial objectives and short-term business profits. Railways were built primarily to serve British commercial interests rather than Indian industrialization, linking raw material-producing regions to ports rather than facilitating domestic economic integration.

### **Conflicts of Interest Among British Industrialists**

While British industrialists in India benefited from imperial policies, conflicts emerged over specific economic measures. British-run cotton mills in India, for instance, favored tariffs on imported cotton textiles but faced an excise duty imposed in 1896 to ‘countervail’ the duty on British imports. Similarly, British firms sought tariff protection for industries like paper and sugar, but imperial policy generally discouraged such measures to maintain free trade ideals. British businessmen in India also resisted control by British finance capital from London, fearing loss of autonomy. This tension illustrated that while British businesses in India gained significant advantages, they were still subject to the larger goals of imperial policy, which sometimes sacrificed individual industrial interests for the broader financial stability of the empire.

### **Impact of British Economic Policies on Indian Entrepreneurs**

British policies systematically discouraged Indian entrepreneurship through legal, administrative, and financial barriers. While Indian entrepreneurs existed, they faced racial discrimination and lacked government support. British firms dominated industries dependent on government patronage, external trade, and finance. The fear of Indian industrial competition led British business interests to resist protectionist policies that could have benefited local enterprises. Indigenous Indian business communities, particularly in Bombay and Ahmedabad, faced immense hurdles in accessing credit, government contracts, and technological advancements, limiting their growth despite their resilience and ingenuity.

### **Debunking Alternative Explanations for India’s Industrial Backwardness**

Some historians attribute India’s lack of industrialization to factors such as a shortage of capital or the supposed inferior quality of Indian entrepreneurs. ==However, evidence suggests that the real constraints were imperial economic policies==. India had merchant classes, banking systems, and transport networks, yet industrialization was stifled by British policies prioritizing wealth extraction over local development. Capital shortages were artificially induced, as Indian surpluses were siphoned off rather than reinvested domestically. The systemic barriers imposed by British rule created an economic environment in which Indian businesses could not thrive, contradicting claims that India’s industrial stagnation was purely a result of internal deficiencies.

### **Structural Constraints on Industrial Growth**

- **Low Internal Demand**: Widespread poverty and income inequality limited domestic markets for industrial goods, as most of the population could not afford manufactured products.
    
- **Education Deficit**: A poorly educated workforce increased production costs and hindered the adaptation of industrial techniques, reducing India’s ability to compete in high-skill industries.
    
- **Lack of Capital Goods Industry**: The absence of domestic capital goods production forced India to rely on expensive imports, further slowing industrialization and increasing dependency on British manufacturers.
    
- **Foreign Investment in Extractive Sectors**: Most foreign capital was directed toward plantations and raw material extraction, with limited spillover benefits to Indian industry, further entrenching India’s role as a supplier of raw materials rather than a producer of finished goods.
    

### **Regional Industrial Disparities and Their Long-Term Consequences**

Before World War I, Indian industrialization was concentrated in a few enclaves—primarily Bombay and Calcutta. European firms dominated extractive industries, while the Indian business class remained weak due to structural constraints. The regional disparity in industrialization contributed to economic divisions that later played a role in the partition of India. The lack of industrial development in certain regions reinforced economic inequalities and fostered conditions for communal divisions, exacerbated by later policy failures. Economic underdevelopment in areas that eventually became Pakistan and Bangladesh contributed to political instability, illustrating the long-term consequences of British economic policies.

### **Conclusion**

The British economic policy in India from 1900 to 1939 was designed to preserve India’s role as a vital cog in the imperial system, prioritizing British economic stability over Indian industrial growth. India was deliberately kept from following the industrial paths of other British colonies, ensuring continued dependence on Britain. The economic subjugation of India through financial transfers, monopolistic trade policies, and racial discrimination resulted in industrial stagnation, regional economic disparities, and limited domestic entrepreneurship. These policies had long-term consequences, contributing to India's economic struggles and political tensions leading to partition. The legacy of British economic exploitation left India with structural weaknesses that took decades to overcome, reinforcing the argument that imperialism was not a benign force but a system designed to benefit the colonial rulers at the expense of the colonized.

## INDIAN OPINION ON ECONOMIC POLICY AFTER THE FIRST WORLD WAR

**Summary**

During the post-World War I period, significant changes occurred in the relationship between Great Britain and its colonies, including India. The Indian economy remained linked to imperial interests but saw a weakening of economic ties with Britain. Japan emerged as a key competitor in the textile industry, threatening Britain's dominance in Indian markets. By 1933, Japanese cotton piece goods accounted for 50% of Indian imports, drastically reducing Britain's market share. In response, British authorities granted limited economic concessions to Indian businessmen to secure their allegiance, given Britain's declining economic grip on India.

Despite these changes, Indian economic thought did not significantly outpace British policies. Calls for state support of industries and industrialization under private enterprise remained limited. The economic challenges of the 1920s, particularly the global depression, hindered industrialization. The Indian economy contracted by nearly 5% in 1930, and unemployment surged. Moreover, addressing regional economic disparities and social inequalities required socialist measures, such as income redistribution and equitable development opportunities. However, Indian business elites, having profited from wartime shortages and trade in yarn and opium, remained committed to free enterprise and refrained from challenging the prevailing economic framework.

Both British rulers and Indian businessmen adhered to financial conservatism. The Indian Retrenchment Committee (1922–1923), including Indian members, endorsed drastic budgetary cutbacks. Indian business leaders were critical of slow tariff protection and monetary deflation policies aimed at maintaining the rupee's external value at 1s. 6d. However, their criticisms were rooted in conventional mercantilist views rather than in calls for structural economic reform. Effective industrial growth required socialist planning, which neither the British government nor Indian capitalists were willing to pursue. Instead, Indian businessmen sought protective tariffs within a limited industrialization framework that constrained broader economic interventions.

The 1930s depression widened economic disparities between industrialized and backward regions and between commercial elites and marginalized communities. Landowners and representatives of agrarian provinces opposed tariff protection, as it favored industrialists at their expense. However, some landlords invested in industry, and protection of industries reliant on agricultural raw materials provided indirect benefits to agricultural producers.

The economic crisis of the 1930s saw increased political discourse on economic planning. The All India Congress Committee (AICC) established a National Planning Committee in 1938 under Jawaharlal Nehru. However, discussions on planning largely assumed a capitalist economic order and anticipated collaboration with British and foreign capitalists. Rather than advocating for socialist economic restructuring, planning efforts resembled statist models, such as those in Prussia under Bismarck or modern Turkey. The composition of the National Planning Committee, which included big business representatives alongside socialists and near-communists, reflected this contradiction. Nehru himself later remarked that the committee’s deliberations had an "air of unreality."

Indian economic and political thought remained constrained by the British imperial system's fundamental principles: a capitalist framework, international capitalist cooperation, resistance to radical social changes, and protection of private property rights. No major forces effectively challenged these assumptions. The only serious opposition came from the Muslim League, which, rather than pushing for systemic economic reform, sought a separate Muslim state. The League's success in achieving Partition underscored the contradictions inherent in India’s dependent capitalist system and highlighted the limited social vision of both nationalist and Muslim League leaders in their anti-colonial struggle.

**Conclusion:** The period after World War I saw significant shifts in India’s economic relationship with Britain, but Indian economic policies remained constrained by imperial structures. Business elites prioritized short-term gains over structural transformation, while economic planning efforts failed to adopt a socialist framework. The contradictions of India’s dependent capitalism persisted, contributing to regional inequalities and social disparities. In the absence of a strong alternative vision, the most significant challenge to the existing order came in the form of communal separatism rather than economic or social restructuring.


## SOME FACTORS BEHIND THE DEMAND FOR A SEPARATE STATE OF PAKISTAN

The secessionist movement that ultimately led to the partition of India had deep and multifaceted roots, encompassing religious, social, economic, and political dimensions. The fundamental ideological divergences between believing Hindus and believing Muslims were exacerbated by the rigid hierarchical structure of the Hindu caste system, which contributed to social tensions. British colonial administrators further widened these divides by adopting a deliberate 'divide-and-rule' policy in response to the surging nationalist movement that had been gaining momentum since the early twentieth century. Additionally, certain early nationalist leaders harbored anti-Muslim sentiments, further alienating Muslim communities and indirectly fostering the rise of communalism.

Economic disparities played a crucial role in fostering secessionist tendencies, manifesting at two distinct levels: (a) between the economically backward districts—many of which had a significant Muslim middle class, particularly in East Bengal and Punjab—who perceived themselves as being systematically marginalized and excluded from political and economic opportunities due to Hindu dominance; and (b) between the well-established Hindu entrepreneurial and professional groups, who had historically dominated commerce, industry, and administrative professions, and the emerging Muslim upper classes, who were striving to carve out an independent economic base. The slow pace of industrialization in British India further exacerbated these economic inequalities. ==Had industrialization progressed more rapidly, market forces might have mitigated some of these disparities by improving the economic prospects of both cultivators and the middle class==. However, industrial growth was slow and concentrated in select regions, leading to uneven economic development.

Punjab and East Bengal played pivotal roles in India's economic structure. Punjab, as a major cotton-producing region, benefited from improvements in irrigation and contributed significantly to India's expanding domestic cotton-mill industry. Simultaneously, East Bengal was practically the sole producer of jute, which was India's most significant export commodity. Despite their economic contributions, Muslim cultivators in these regions remained socioeconomically disadvantaged compared to their Hindu counterparts, creating fertile ground for communal grievances.

Demographic shifts in the twentieth century further reinforced the political weight of Muslim-majority districts. The proportion of Muslims in India’s total population steadily increased from 1881 onwards. Bengal and Assam experienced uninterrupted population growth between 1901 and 1941, driven in part by the large-scale migration of Muslim peasants from East Bengal into Assam. Bengal, the most populous province in India, ==witnessed a population surge from 42 million in 1901 to 60 million in 1941.== This natural population growth, combined with migratory patterns, ensured that the Muslim population increased relative to Hindus. Additionally, evidence suggests that the natural rate of increase among Muslims was higher in certain regions, particularly in the Gangetic delta, further altering the demographic landscape.

Land tenure systems in India had historically evolved in a manner that left many cultivators without legal rights to the land they tilled. This phenomenon was particularly pronounced in East Bengal, where Muslim cultivators constituted the majority, while Hindu landlords owned most of the land. This structural disparity sowed the seeds of communal discord. The economic depression of the 1930s severely affected the jute and rice economy of East Bengal, intensifying rural distress among Muslim peasants. Successive provincial governments, including the so-called 'popular' government elected under the Government of India Act of 1935, failed to implement meaningful reforms to alleviate peasant hardships. The Bengal Land Revenue Commission, appointed in 1938, recommended abolishing the Permanent Settlement and granting tenancy rights to sharecroppers. However, these recommendations were never enforced, deepening Muslim discontent.

Similar economic tensions were evident in Punjab and northwestern India, where Hindu traders and moneylenders controlled much of the economic infrastructure, while Muslim cultivators, constituting the majority of the population, faced chronic economic exploitation. Various legislative measures were introduced to address rural indebtedness, but none resulted in substantial long-term improvements. As a result, mass discontent grew, fueling the appeal of secessionist movements that promised economic and social justice for Muslims.

These economic, social, and demographic conditions strengthened the appeal of separatist ideologies among Muslims in India. While some historians have interpreted the Muslim League’s movement as a reactionary feudal or anti-capitalist force, this perspective overlooks its core motivation: the quest for an independent political and economic platform for the Muslim middle class. The Muslim League, led by legal professionals and big landlords, capitalized on the economic frustrations of Muslim business owners and professionals, who struggled to compete against entrenched Hindu elites in commerce, industry, and public administration.

Indian nationalist leaders recognized the economic disparities between Hindus and Muslims but largely failed to propose effective corrective measures. C.R. Das, a prominent Swarajist leader, sought to implement affirmative action policies to bridge this economic gap. He proposed reserving 60% of government jobs and 80% of Calcutta Corporation seats for Muslims until parity with Hindus was achieved. However, his untimely death led to the abandonment of these initiatives, leaving Muslim grievances unaddressed.

Jawaharlal Nehru, in his writings, repeatedly analyzed the economic underpinnings of Hindu-Muslim communal tensions. He highlighted how Muslim cultivators were systematically exploited by Hindu landlords and moneylenders, and how Muslim entrepreneurs faced formidable obstacles in competing with well-established Hindu business classes. In 'Glimpses of World History,' he identified the economic exploitation of Muslim weavers and tenants by Hindu traders and landlords as the fundamental cause of Hindu-Muslim discord. In his autobiography, he argued that communal political rivalries in the 1920s and 1930s were, at their core, middle-class job struggles, with economic inequalities between Hindus and Muslims in Punjab and Bengal playing a decisive role. ==Nehru observed that while Bombay had emerged as the hub of Indian-owned commerce and industry, Calcutta remained dominated by British capital, with Indian business interests largely represented by Marwaris and Gujaratis.==

Despite these astute observations, Nehru and the Congress leadership failed to draw the necessary conclusions regarding policy solutions. They did not recognize that eliminating legal and social discrimination alone was insufficient to uplift economically and socially disadvantaged Muslim communities. Meaningful affirmative policies were required to rectify historical inequalities. Likewise, underdeveloped regions required disproportionate public investment to counteract the natural tendency of private capital to concentrate in already developed areas. However, such progressive interventions were largely absent from the Congress Party’s agenda, which was shaped by economically privileged business and professional elites.

This failure to address economic and social grievances provided fertile ground for the Muslim League’s demand for a separate state. ==Contrary to claims that the League sought to restore a feudal order, its primary objective was to secure an independent state where Muslim professionals and business owners could operate without competition from dominant Hindu elites.== While the creation of Pakistan allowed certain segments of Muslim society, particularly landlords and urban elites, to consolidate their positions, the broader socioeconomic benefits for Muslim peasants and the working class were limited and often temporary.

Post-independence economic developments in Pakistan mirrored those of India. Industrial growth was driven by merchant communities with deep-rooted trading connections rather than by Western-educated professionals. The rapid expansion of private investment in Pakistan surprised many economists who underestimated the role of political arrangements in economic development. However, structural inequalities, social tensions, and geopolitical challenges continued to shape Pakistan’s economic trajectory.

In conclusion, the partition of India was the culmination of complex socio-economic and political forces rather than a mere byproduct of religious differences. The limited industrial growth in British India prior to 1939, the entrenched disparities between Hindu and Muslim communities, and the Congress Party’s reluctance to adopt transformative economic policies collectively contributed to the conditions that made partition seem inevitable. The struggle for a just and equitable economic order in the subcontinent was effectively sidelined by communal politics, delaying meaningful efforts to address the deep-rooted socio-economic inequalities that had fueled the separatist movement.

## THE SPREAD OF MODERN INDUSTRY IN DIFFERENT REGIONS OF INDIA
==Between 1900 and 1939, India underwent significant industrial transformation, particularly in the textile sector, achieving near self-sufficiency in cotton textile production and emerging as a major exporter of cotton piece goods by the Second World War.== This period witnessed the rise of several modern industries, including steel and cement, which could be broadly categorized as producer goods industries. Although refined sugar production using large-scale modern methods had begun before 1900, its total output remained insignificant until the later part of the period. By the late 1930s, however, the industry had expanded enough to meet India's internal demand for refined sugar. Additionally, the match and paper industries, employing large-scale units, also became prominent.

Despite this industrial progress, modern large-scale production remained largely confined to consumer goods and basic producer goods industries. ==By 1939, India was still heavily reliant on imports for machinery, machine tools, and chemicals. Some progress had been made in the production of heavy chemicals, such as caustic soda and sulphuric acid==, but the development of industries manufacturing complex machinery was minimal. Although some crude machinery and machine tools were produced during the First World War, these facilities were dismantled post-war due to a lack of demand and government support. A significant step toward industrial independence in this sector only began after the outbreak of the Second World War, with the initiation of cotton-textile machinery production.

### Regional Industrial Investment Patterns

Before the First World War, industrial investment in India was primarily concentrated in the two major commercial hubs—Bombay and Calcutta. However, Ahmedabad, within the Bombay Presidency, was emerging as a notable center for cotton mills. Even after the war, industrial investments were dominated by Bombay’s and Ahmedabad’s cotton mills and Bengal’s jute mills along the Hooghly River. Over time, this investment pattern diversified due to several factors:

1. **The rise of the cement industry**, which catered to different regions of India.
2. **Depression in Bombay’s cotton mills** from 1923 onwards and Bengal’s jute mills from 1928 onwards.
3. **The emergence of the sugar industry** in the United Provinces and Bihar, which contributed to regional industrial dispersion.

The cotton textile industry played a crucial role in this expansion. Between 1914 and 1939, the number of spindles in India increased from 6.62 million to 10.06 million, while looms grew from 967,000 to 202,400. Notably, industrial expansion was faster in regions outside Bombay and Ahmedabad, with rapid growth in Delhi, Cawnpore (United Provinces), and South Indian centers such as Coimbatore, Madura, and Madras.

Several factors facilitated this industrial diffusion:

- **Cheaper labor** in these new industrial centers.
- **The availability of hydroelectric power,** particularly in South India.
- **Tariff protection**, which created local markets for Indian manufacturers.

The emergence of new industrial centers was also accompanied by the rise of local entrepreneurship. In South India, many former trading communities transitioned into industrial enterprises, with the Chettiars being the most well-known among them. However, industrial entrepreneurship was not solely dominated by this group. In central Indian states such as Gwalior, Bhopal, and Indore, Jains and Marwaris—who had previously been involved in trade—became major players in the newly established textile mills. Ahmedabad, which expanded faster than Bombay, saw its capitalists venture beyond cotton textiles into cement, sugar, and chemicals. Baroda, due to its proximity to Ahmedabad, similarly experienced industrial growth fueled by capital inflows from Ahmedabad.

Although Bombay's dominance in textile production declined in comparison to new industrial centers like Coimbatore, Cawnpore, and Ahmedabad, its capitalists—led by the Tata group—remained highly influential in other sectors, including iron and steel, cement, shipping, and chemicals.

### The Sugar Industry and North Indian Business Groups

In North India, sugar emerged as the most significant sector attracting capital investment. Both well-established business groups (e.g., Begg, Sutherland and Company, and Juggilal Kamlapat) and new entrants (such as Narangs, Dalmia Sahu Jain, and Birla Brothers) capitalized on the opportunities in the sugar industry.

However, one region that remained relatively untouched by industrial expansion was **Punjab, Sind, and the North-Western Frontier Provinces**—an area that later became West Pakistan. The reasons for this lack of industrial development are complex but include:

4. **Limited energy resources:** The region lacked coal deposits and did not develop hydroelectric power infrastructure on the scale seen in South India.
5. **Vulnerability to agricultural shocks:** While the extension of irrigation in Punjab and Sind improved peasant prosperity in the 1920s, the agricultural depression hit this region particularly hard due to its reliance on agricultural exports.
6. **Absence of a strong entrepreneurial class:** Unlike central, southern, or eastern India, this region did not have a business community with the necessary capital, trade networks, or industrial experience to drive large-scale manufacturing.

Despite these limitations, **Punjab did experience some small-scale industrialization**, primarily in the form of foundries and workshops catering to agricultural needs. These small industrialists, however, struggled to compete with the larger business houses of India.

### Political Implications of Industrial Disparities

The industrial underdevelopment of Punjab, Sind, and East Bengal—despite their status as major raw material suppliers (Punjab for long-staple cotton and East Bengal for jute)—played a role in the growing demand for a separate Muslim state. The economic disparities fueled political arguments for Muslim control over industrial policy. In Punjab, the **relatively prosperous peasantry of the canal colonies and the rise of small-scale entrepreneurs** reinforced this demand.

After the creation of Pakistan, the political separation of the northwest from India provided local industrialists in the region with a **protected market**, shielding them from competition and allowing them time to develop an independent industrial base.

### Conclusion

The period from 1900 to 1939 saw India undergo significant industrialization, particularly in textiles, steel, cement, sugar, and chemicals. While the industrial landscape expanded beyond its traditional nodes of Bombay and Calcutta, regional disparities remained stark. South India benefited from cheaper labor and hydroelectric power, while central Indian business communities played a crucial role in industrial expansion. However, the **lack of industrial development in Punjab, Sind, and East Bengal**, despite their agricultural wealth, underscored the **non-automatic link between agricultural prosperity and industrialization**. These disparities contributed to political demands for separate Muslim industrial control, shaping the economic rationale for the partition of India in 1947.

## TWO PHASES IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF INDIAN ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND INDUSTRY

The interwar period (1919–1939) in India witnessed significant transformations in industrial investment, trade relations with Britain, and the role of Indian entrepreneurs. This period can be distinctly divided into two phases: (1) the 1920s, characterized by the continuation of older industrial and trade structures, and (2) the 1930s, marked by a radical shift due to the Great Depression and evolving state policies.

#### **Industrial Investment and Entrepreneurship in the 1920s**

During the 1920s, Indian industry was still dominated by established business groups, while emerging industrialists such as the Birlas, Sri Ram, and Juggilal Kamlapat began expanding their influence. The period saw the continued dominance of European capital, particularly in the jute and textile industries. Imports of jute-textile machinery were a significant portion of total industrial machinery imports, reflecting the sector’s centrality. Up to 1930–31, such imports rarely fell below a quarter of total industrial machinery imports but declined in the 1930s. The overall trend indicated a reliance on imported machinery, underscoring India’s continued economic dependence on Britain.

Investment in textiles was dominant in the early 1920s, benefiting European capitalists entrenched in the jute industry and established Indian and European capitalists in Bombay and Ahmedabad. Although new Indian industrial groups were emerging, there was no widespread entrepreneurial boom during this decade. Economic policies, including selective tariff protections for iron, steel, and paper industries, were insufficient in fostering large-scale industrialization.

Trade relations between India and Britain remained structurally unchanged despite shifts in global economic patterns after 1914. India’s trade surplus with the U.S. (£19 million in 1929) helped balance Britain’s trade deficit with America, while Indian credit balances with Ceylon, Malaya, and South Africa played a role in sustaining Britain’s imperial financial system. Although India’s adverse balance with Britain decreased slightly, it remained significant.

Thus, while Indian entrepreneurs were making cautious inroads into industry through import substitution and political maneuvering, no decisive shift occurred until the economic crisis of the 1930s.

#### **Impact of the Great Depression (1930s) on Industrial and Trade Relations**

The Great Depression fundamentally altered India’s economic relationship with Britain. The bilateral balance between the two countries improved, British exports to India fell sharply, and the share of British imports in India’s trade declined. However, the share of Britain in India’s exports increased due to Britain's relative economic resilience compared to other advanced capitalist nations and the policies of **Imperial Preference**.

The U.K.’s trade relations with its Empire grew stronger, as the share of Empire countries in Britain’s exports rose from 39.5% in 1929 to 45.6% in 1938. ==The Government of India repaid substantial portions of its London-raised debt between 1931 and 1935, reducing its reliance on British capital markets. This marked an increasing financial independence==.

Economic policies also changed in response to the depression. The Government of India, under fiscal pressure, was forced to implement tariff protection more broadly, benefitting local industrialists. The expansion of domestic markets led to industrial growth beyond the traditional centers, especially in textiles, sugar, and paper industries. Concurrently, shifts in political dynamics allowed Indian entrepreneurs greater influence. The **Government of India Act (1935)** and subsequent provincial autonomy enabled Indian industrialists to participate in policy formulation, with figures such as **M.A. Muthiah Chettiar, Sir Jwala Prasad Srivastava, Sir Gokul Chand Narang, and Sir Bejoy Prosad Singh Roy** assuming ministerial roles in their respective provinces.

#### **Emergence of New Entrepreneurial Groups and Industrial Expansion**

The rise of Indian industrialists in this period was less tied to caste identity and more to their pre-industrial engagement in trade and finance. The dominant industrialist group—the **Marwaris**—were primarily traders before entering industry, while in Punjab and Northwest India, **Aroras and Khatris** (claiming Kshatriya status) became significant industrial players. Many future Pakistani industrialists came from Muslim trading castes.

Industrial investment was driven by capitalists who had accumulated wealth from trade, money-lending, or other commercial activities. Tariff protection incentivized domestic production over trade, leading to a modest expansion in capital-intensive industries such as iron, steel, sugar, and paper. However, the development of **capital goods industries** remained limited, and modern industry’s share in the national income was relatively low.

Employment in modern industry remained marginal, with total factory employment (including seasonal factories) increasing only from **1.95 million (1937) to 2.05 million (1939)**. While there was a gradual shift in occupational structure between 1931 and 1941, industrial employment remained insufficient to drive large-scale economic transformation.

#### **Foreign Capital and Structural Constraints on Indian Industry**

Despite indigenous capitalists gaining a greater share of modern industry compared to pre-1914 levels, foreign capital remained dominant in core industrial sectors. European-controlled firms retained significant influence, and new **multinational corporations such as Unilever, ITC, Dunlop, and General Motors** began establishing Indian subsidiaries, further entrenching foreign control.

India’s industrialization in the 1930s did not result in technological innovation or significant improvements in production methods. Capitalists relied heavily on imported Western technologies and lacked a broad technical workforce. Industrial growth was primarily confined to **consumer goods industries**, with little expansion in capital goods manufacturing.

#### **Structural Weaknesses of the Indian Economy by 1939**

By 1939, India remained a **colonial, agrarian economy** with limited industrial development. The land-tenure system was highly complex, burdened by multiple intermediary rights, and capitalist farming was rare. The administrative structure was geared toward colonial governance rather than economic modernization.

While the industrial sector had grown, most of the development was in **consumer goods industries**, and foreign capital still controlled key sectors. Additionally, industrialization was regionally uneven, with certain areas remaining underdeveloped. The competition between emerging capitalist groups for market and resource control, particularly between different regional business elites, contributed to internal economic conflicts that later influenced the **Partition of India**.

At the same time, **anti-colonial movements intensified**, reflecting the broader dissatisfaction with British economic policies. When independence came in 1947, India’s industrial capitalist class, though still small and financially weak, was in a **far stronger position** than before, ready to leverage state power for its expansion in the post-colonial era.

#### **Conclusion**

The interwar period saw Indian entrepreneurs gradually expand their industrial presence, albeit within constraints imposed by colonial policies, foreign capital, and economic crises. While tariff protection facilitated industrial growth in the 1930s, industrial investment remained concentrated in **consumer goods** rather than capital goods. The Depression altered India’s trade relations, fostering greater domestic industrialization but also reinforcing imperial economic dependencies. Although new Indian entrepreneurial groups emerged, foreign capitalists retained significant influence, and the industrial sector’s contribution to national income remained limited. By the eve of independence, India had made **incremental but not revolutionary** strides toward industrial modernization.
