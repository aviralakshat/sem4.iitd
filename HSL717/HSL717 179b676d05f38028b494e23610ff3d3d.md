### **Chapter 2: Integrating Growth and Development**

### **Economic Growth: Contrasting Perspectives**

- In 2012, while Europe celebrated zero growth as a victory over recession, India's 6.2% growth was deemed "dismal." This highlights how growth is relative to expectations and context.
- Authors argue that economic growth must be seen not as an end but as a tool to generate resources for development. Growth enables:
    - **Higher public revenue** to fund essential services.
    - **Increased individual incomes**, improving living standards.

### **The History of India's Growth Journey**

- **Post-independence stagnation**:
    - For nearly three decades after 1947, India's economy grew at a sluggish rate of 3.5% annually, sarcastically termed the "Hindu rate of growth."
    - This pace reflected limited industrialization, policy inefficiencies, and a lack of focus on human capital.
- **Growth acceleration**:
    - 1980s: Growth climbed to 5% due to a mix of agricultural reforms (Green Revolution) and reduced trade barriers.
    - 1990s reforms under Finance Minister Manmohan Singh liberalized trade, opened markets, and reduced bureaucratic control. Growth rates soared to 7-9% post-1995.
    - Yet, the period saw rising inequalities and failed to address mass poverty.

### **The Dual Role of Growth**

- Growth helps generate resources, but its **distribution** is key:
    - **China's model**: Growth in agriculture and manufacturing directly improved rural incomes and reduced poverty.
    - **India's model**: Growth, driven by services and urban industries, excluded large rural and unskilled populations.
- **"Jobless growth"** in India resulted from:
    - Over-reliance on skill-intensive sectors like IT and finance.
    - Neglect of traditional labor-intensive sectors like textiles and small-scale manufacturing.

### **Colonial Legacy and Planning Failures**

- **Colonial roots**:
    - Pre-colonial India was a global trade hub, renowned for textile exports. However, colonial policies systematically dismantled this, leading to industrial decline and poverty.
- **Post-independence plans**:
    - India's early planners focused on heavy industries and state-led growth but neglected human development.
    - The “Basic Education” model, inspired by Gandhi, emphasized self-financing handicrafts over universal schooling, leaving masses illiterate.
    - Comparatively, Communist countries like China prioritized universal education and health, ensuring inclusive growth.

### **The Need for Inclusive Growth**

- Authors argue that sustained growth is essential for reducing poverty but must be equitable. Key reforms suggested:
    - **Investing in education**:
        - Improving primary and secondary education quality
        - Expanding vocational training programs
        - Focusing on digital literacy and technical skills
        - Creating industry-education partnerships
    - **Strengthening health systems**:
        - Expanding rural healthcare infrastructure
        - Implementing universal health coverage
        - Focusing on preventive healthcare
        - Training more healthcare workers
    - **Addressing inequality**:
        - Developing rural infrastructure and connectivity
        - Providing agricultural subsidies and technical support
        - Creating social security for informal workers
        - Implementing targeted poverty reduction programs

### **Chapter 3: India in Comparative Perspective**

### **India’s Rising GDP but Stagnant Living Standards**

- India's high GDP growth has created excitement, branding it as an emerging economic superpower. However, the benefits of growth are limited to the top 20% of the population.
- Millions remain trapped in poverty, excluded from progress in health, education, and infrastructure.
- Authors criticize this **"growth without development"** model and emphasize the need for equitable growth.

### **Comparisons with Non-African Poor Nations**

- India’s GDP per capita is higher than many non-African poor countries, yet its social indicators lag:
    - **Child undernutrition**: 40% of Indian children are underweight, compared to 25% in sub-Saharan Africa.
    - **Female literacy**: India’s female literacy rate (65%) is among the lowest outside Africa.
    - **Sanitation**: Only 36% of the population has access to improved sanitation, worse than countries with much lower incomes.

### **Lessons from South Asia**

- **Bangladesh**:
    - Despite half India’s per capita income, Bangladesh outperforms in life expectancy (69 vs. 65 years), child mortality, and female literacy.
    - Strong focus on public health, family planning, and women’s empowerment drove these gains.
- **Nepal**:
    - Nepal, with one-third of India’s income, matches India in health and education indicators. Community-based initiatives and NGO interventions played key roles.
- **Pakistan**:
    - Despite political instability, Pakistan has made greater strides in child immunization and maternal health, often surpassing India.

### **Why Growth Isn’t Enough**

- India’s economic growth has failed to address fundamental issues:
    - **Education**: High illiteracy, especially among women, due to underfunded public schooling.
    - **Healthcare**: Low public health spending (1.2% of GDP) leaves millions reliant on unregulated private care, leading to exploitation.
    - **Nutrition**: Child malnutrition rates have barely improved despite decades of growth.

### **India’s Decline in Regional Rankings**

- India's performance in social indicators has worsened compared to its South Asian neighbors:
    - Life expectancy: Bangladesh (69) and Sri Lanka (76) outpace India (65).
    - Child mortality: Bangladesh has halved child mortality since 1990, while India lags.
    - Female empowerment: India’s gender inequality is more pronounced than in Bangladesh or Sri Lanka.

### **Key Themes and Messages**

1. **Growth Without Equity**:
    - Economic growth must translate into improved living conditions for all segments of society.
    - India's emphasis on services and urban development has left rural and marginalized populations behind.
2. **Learning from Comparisons**:
    - Countries like Bangladesh, Nepal, and Vietnam demonstrate how focused investments in health, education, and nutrition can drive significant progress despite limited resources.
3. **Investing in Human Capabilities**:
    - Following Amartya Sen's "capability approach," prioritizing education, healthcare, and gender equality is essential to unlock the population's potential.
4. **The Role of Public Policy**:
    - Public spending on social services—education, healthcare, and sanitation—requires significant expansion.
    - Enhanced accountability in public services is crucial to reduce corruption and improve outcomes.
5. **Environmental Sustainability**:
    - Rapid growth has caused severe environmental degradation, including water table depletion and air pollution. Future development must balance ecological preservation with poverty reduction.

## Development as Freedom : Amartya Sen

### CHAPTER 1: THE PERSPECTIVE OF FREEDOM

**Key Concepts:**

- Development is the process of expanding substantive freedoms for individuals, not merely about economic growth or income increases.
- Freedom involves both **process freedoms** (e.g., the ability to vote or express oneself) and **opportunity freedoms** (e.g., access to education and healthcare).

**Maitreyee and Yajnavalkya’s Dialogue:**

- Sen opens with a conversation from the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, where Maitreyee questions the value of wealth if it cannot bring immortality. This dialogue underscores the distinction between material wealth and what truly enhances the quality of life.
- Wealth is useful, but only as a means to achieve freedoms and capabilities—not as an end in itself.

**The Role of Freedom in Development:**

- Sen contrasts economic wealth with human achievements, arguing that wealth does not automatically translate into freedoms or well-being.
- Aristotle’s view—“wealth is merely useful for the sake of something else”—aligns with Sen’s perspective that development must be about expanding freedoms.

**Forms of Unfreedom:**

- Sen identifies various unfreedom: famines, lack of healthcare, poor education, gender inequality, and political repression. lack of sanitary arrangement, morbidity,
- Even wealthy nations face challenges such as healthcare disparities and systemic inequalities.
- Democratic governance is vital. Democracies are accountable to the people and have historically prevented famines, as seen in India’s post-independence history compared to authoritarian regimes like China during the Great Leap Forward famine.

**Freedom as Both Means and End:**

- Freedom is both the primary objective of development (constitutive role) and a tool to achieve further development (instrumental role).
- Development entails creating conditions for individuals to live the lives they value and to participate actively in society.

### CHAPTER 2: THE ENDS AND THE MEANS OF DEVELOPMENT

**Development as Freedom:**

- Development is about expanding the real freedoms people enjoy. This involves enhancing human capabilities such as being healthy, literate, and politically active.

**Constitutive and Instrumental Roles of Freedom:**

1. **Constitutive Role**: Freedoms like political participation, literacy, and healthcare are intrinsic parts of development.
2. **Instrumental Role**: Freedoms interlink to strengthen development—e.g., education fosters political engagement, which in turn can improve public policies.

**Instrumental Freedoms:**

1. **Political Freedoms**: Voting rights, uncensored press, and freedom of expression.
2. **Economic Facilities**: Access to resources for production, consumption, and exchange, influenced by distribution and market access.
3. **Social Opportunities**: Availability of healthcare and education, which empower individuals and enable participation in economic and political spheres.
4. **Transparency Guarantees**: Trust and openness in social and economic interactions, preventing corruption and inefficiency.
5. **Protective Security**: Safety nets, such as unemployment benefits and famine relief, prevent people from falling into extreme deprivation.

**Interconnections and Complementarities:**

- These freedoms reinforce each other. For example, education enhances economic participation, and transparency reduces corruption, fostering economic growth.

### Summary of *Development as Freedom* by Amartya Sen

### Chapter 1: The Perspective of Freedom

- **Core Concept**: Development is fundamentally about expanding the freedoms people value, not just increasing economic wealth. Freedom encompasses the ability to live a good life, pursue opportunities, and engage in society.
- **Maitreyee’s Question**: Citing the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, Sen uses the rhetorical question, "What should I do with wealth that does not bring immortality?" to illustrate the limitations of material wealth alone in ensuring a fulfilling life.
- **Economic Wealth vs. Capability**: There is a connection between wealth and human achievements, but it is neither absolute nor uniform. Development must go beyond income growth and focus on substantive freedoms like education, health, and political participation.
- **Forms of Unfreedom**:
    - Famine, undernutrition, lack of healthcare, and premature mortality are examples of unfreedom.
    - Even affluent societies suffer from disparities in education, employment, and healthcare access.
    - Political and civil rights violations undermine freedom and often fail to ensure economic growth (disproving the "Lee Thesis" that authoritarianism fosters development).
    - No famine has occurred in a functioning democracy because democratic accountability incentivizes governments to prevent such crises.
- **Importance of Freedom**: Freedom is both constitutive (a goal of development) and instrumental (a means to achieve development). It enables agency, or individuals' capacity to act, influence, and bring about change.

### Chapter 2: The Ends and Means of Development

- **Development as Freedom**: Development is viewed as a process of expanding freedoms, involving two roles:
    1. **Constitutive Role**: Freedom is an intrinsic part of development (e.g., literacy, health, political participation).
    2. **Instrumental Role**: Freedoms interrelate and contribute to broader human development.
- **Instrumental Freedoms**:
    1. **Political Freedoms**: Include civil rights, democratic governance, and freedom of expression.
    2. **Economic Facilities**: Access to resources for production, consumption, and exchange.
    3. **Social Opportunities**: Basic healthcare, education, and welfare provisions.
    4. **Transparency Guarantees**: Trust in societal dealings, reducing corruption.
    5. **Protective Security**: Social safety nets to prevent destitution and ensure resilience.
- **Interconnections**: Development success lies in integrating freedoms across these domains, such as using economic growth to finance public services or linking education with political empowerment.

### Key Case Studies and Data

- **India and China**:
    - China's pre-reform commitment to health and education prepared it for market reforms in 1979, yielding significant economic benefits.
    - India’s 1991 reforms were less successful due to poor social infrastructure and widespread illiteracy.
    - Democratic India avoided famine due to public accountability, unlike authoritarian China’s Great Leap Forward famine (30 million deaths).
- **Support-Led vs. Growth-Mediated Strategies**:
    - **Support-Led**: Focus on social programs (e.g., Kerala, Sri Lanka) to improve health and literacy despite low income.
    - **Growth-Mediated**: Use economic growth to invest in social development (e.g., East Asian economies).
- **African Americans in the U.S.**:
    - Despite higher income levels, their life expectancy lags behind poorer populations in Kerala, India, and China due to disparities in health and social services.

### Philosophical and Historical Insights

- **Aristotle and Adam Smith**: The idea that wealth is instrumental and not an end itself aligns with classical thoughts on human flourishing and capabilities.
- **Labor and Freedom**:
    - Transition from bonded labor to free-market labor in agrarian societies represents a fundamental expansion of freedom.
    - The abolition of slavery highlights the intrinsic value of freedom over material gains.
- **Participation and Tradition**:
    - Development must empower people to make informed decisions about preserving or changing traditions, rejecting authoritarian dictates or rigid traditionalism.

### Conclusion

Sen emphasizes that freedom is central to understanding and achieving development. By focusing on removing unfreedoms and enhancing human capabilities, societies can create more inclusive, equitable, and sustainable pathways to progress. Development as freedom is not only a moral imperative but also a practical strategy for creating resilient and flourishing societies.

# Class notes 13.01

Growth (of Incomes) ⇒ Achievements

Commodities ⇒ Capabilities [Freedoms]

Income grows can never be at par.

Aristotle views - that closely aligns with sen views that says wealth can be used using epanding horizons in form of freedom 

1. Being educated
2. Being financially secure
3. able to buy
4. able to travel
5. being healthy
6. safe

### Interconnection and reinforcement of instrumental freedom -

instrumental freedom like education, economical, social, health, political they are interconnected

- When economic growth is high then
    - Social Development is high but social development (east Asia) can also be high with low incomes (Brazil, Kerala). Meaning you do no need to be rich to enjoy freedom.
- Growth depreciation is not a problem of huge population. Population is one of the biggest instrument which can be tapped for better development. As time passes, the demography grows old.
    - Training will be used to tap the demography and achieve the dividend.
- Kerela spends 50% of revenue expenditure - paying to salaries, there are pvt. managed schools but gov. paid their bills.
- Doctor per 1000 is .7

### Role of Markets and governments -

He mentions about India China contrast. When it opened to market, china was socially was very well prepared as compared to India. Independent India never had a famine but had many chronic undernutrition but china had 30M people died in China.
