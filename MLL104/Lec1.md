We are going to follow a lifecycle approach.
### Poverty
Deprivations on various aspects of ==well being==. Basic needs were in the early debates of poverty in India.

#### Expenditure v/s income 
1. miscalculation of the income 
2. income can stop but the expenditure goes on.
#### Individual vs Household
standard prac - x=X/n (x=per capita expe. X=Total expe of the household n=no. of mem. in the household)
**Angus Detan questions** - 
1. possibility of intra household inequality
2. possibility of economies of scale in consumption.
3. possibility that even for a given size different households may have different needs depending on their age and sex composition.
#### Head count ration
No. of people below poverty line. doesnt calculate the depth of poverty.
$HCR = \frac{q}{n}, q=no of people below poverty line, n=total no of people$
**Read the 2002 paper.**
